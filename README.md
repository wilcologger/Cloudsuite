## Rules

- The header and hero must be created using HTML, SCSS and vanilla Javascript.
- The text and background image of the hero should scroll at different speeds using a parallax implementation, where none of the scrolling elements can be standing still.
- External Javascript libraries CAN'T be used.
- Make use of Webpack to parse SCSS to CSS and minify JS.
- Create at least four navigation items with at least six sub-items in a dropdown menu.
- The header must be according to the design.
- The header must be sticky and transparent at the top of the page.
- When sticky the background color changes to white.

## Questions and comments

- I never made a parallax scrolling element before so i hope this is wat it must do.
- This is my first time making a JSON file and make it work with my own code.
- I know what webpack is but i did not use it in this project. If i use it in this project then i lost time and i did not want that. But i want to learn how to do it in the end.
- I lookt at the pixels and i have the feeling it is al little bit off but realy close.
- I did not make it responsive but there was also no need for it or a design of it.
